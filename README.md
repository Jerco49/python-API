# python-API
This was a homework assignment given to me by the Rutgers Data Science Boot Camp. It is a test of my knowledge of how to work APIs. My assignment was to perform an API call to openweathermap.org and convert the data received into various plots. While this is but one of many assignments given to me, I felt most accomplished by this one because using APIs are not as straightforward as creating code. Each source has their own way of setting up their APIs with different tables and data structures, as well as different types of documentation. So in order for me to get my desired result, I had to stretch outside the bounds of coding and try to understand the data I was trying to pull.

This assignment was all done using Python (used from Jupyter Notebook), with specific use of API calls, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
